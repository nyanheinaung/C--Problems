Problem
There are N submarine volcanoes in a given ocean area. 
When an undersea volcano erupts, the lava cools and hardens, forming an island in a circle with radius R centered at the location of the volcano. 
When multiple submarine volcanoes erupt at the same time, the islands formed by the submarine volcanoes that are less than 2R apart from each other will combine to form a single island.

Find the number of islands that would form if all the submarine volcanoes erupted at the same time.

The location of the submarine volcano is given in (x, y) coordinates. 
The x and y coordinates of a given island are given as integers greater than or equal to 0, but please note that the range of the island created by the eruption may extend to the negative x and y coordinates.
