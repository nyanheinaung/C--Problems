Problem
You need and order one of each of product numbers 1 through N.
However, after receiving the products, we discovered that we had placed incorrect orders, including ordering unnecessary products and multiple orders for the same product.

It can't be helped that you ordered the wrong product, but it's a problem if you don't receive the product you need.
You decide to place an additional order and find out how many of the products you need have not yet arrived.

You will be given a list of products that have arrived, so print out how many of the required products numbered 1 through N have not arrived.

In the case of input example 1, products numbered 1 to 5 are required, but products numbered 3 and 5 have not arrived due to an order error. Two types are missing, so please output 2.
