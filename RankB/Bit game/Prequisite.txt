Problem
This game is played with N players.
At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a card hand. 
Each card hand consists of 3 numbers, either 0 or 1.
All players have to transform their card hands to the common deck.
Each common deck have an alphabet, either a, b or c and 3 numbers, either 0 or 1.
Transform the curent deck according to the following rule.

・When  a, if there is even one 1, generate 1, otherwise generate 0.
・When b, if there is even one 0, generate 0, otherwise generate 1. Generate
・When c, generate 1 if the numbers are different, and generate 0 if the numbers are the same.

When all the cards have been turned over, 
the player with the highest final integer in their hand in decimal notation wins.
For example, if the final hands of players 1 and 2 are 101 and 011, respectively, 
player 1 wins because 101 > 11 in decimal notation.

Output the winner.
If there are more than 1 winner, output them all in ascending order.
